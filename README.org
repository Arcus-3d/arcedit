* Overview

This was created to speed up *manually* adding the M163 codes needed for controlling active mixing filament printers, mainly... mine.  
Support for multi-material 3D printing is still young, and currently support for mixed/full color filament printing is basically non-existant.
This method gets around that for the time being as we'll never have weighted material support in a slicer until we are using it in 3d printers.

* Features:

  * Fast, easy to use, 3D interface
  * Parsing and display of weighted material mixing M163 codes
  * Layer by layer/Line by line stepping/playback of gcode.
  * Streamlined visual matching of current extrusion segment to gcode line number.
  * Support for Machinekit velocity extrusion. There is no E.


* Requires:

  * python 2.x (2.7.3 tested)
    http://python.org/
  * pyglet 1.1+ (1.1.4 tested)
    http://www.pyglet.org

* Usage:

  * Generate gcode using the velocity extrusion patched version of Slic3r for Machinekit.
  * Edit config.cfg and setup your filament color RGB values.
  * Load the resulting gcode in your favorite text editor.
  * Execute: arviewer [file.gcode]
  * Use arviewer to locate a suitable point to alter the filament mix ratio.
  * Add some 'M163 filament weights' to your gcode and save.  For example:
    -  M163 S1 P0  - Set filament 1 to no extrusion.
  	-  M163 S2 P10 - Set filament 2 to 10% extrusion.
  	-  M163 S3 P90 - Set filament 3 to 90% extrusion.
  * Press R in arviewer to reload the gcode and see the changes.  The filament RGB value after mixing is calculated per line segment, and the resulting extrusion is displayed in the interface.
  * Repeat the last two steps... a lot.


* Issues:

  * Panning not yet implemented.
  * Adding/Removing M163 codes is still external/manual
  * Designed for Slic3r output.  Other slicing programs may not work.
  * Many gcodes unsupported, in particular:
    - G20: Set Units to Inches (usage unknown) 
    - Arcs (G2 & G3 ?)
